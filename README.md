Event and Implied Situation Ontology (ESO)
========================

This repository contains the Event and Applied Situation Ontology (ESO), developed in Newsreader (www.newsreader-project.eu).


ESO_version2.owl is the latest version of the ontology; the ontology itself is described in ESO_documentation. The folder manual-mappings comprises several files with manually mappings from ESO to FrameNet, SUMO and WordNet.

Further, this repository contains the CEO ontology, which builds upon the metamodel of ESO. CEO is designed for the calamity domain (murders, earthquakes, floodings, evacuations, etc) and allows to infer chains of events based on shared event properties. Current version is version 0.7. DISCLAIMER: CEO is still heavily under construction. We will report it here as soon as we have a first stable version.
